                    <p>Methuselah tree
                        Methuselah is a Great Basin bristlecone pine (pinus longaeva) that is estimated to be between
                        4,800-5,000 years old. Its exact location is kept secret for its safety, but it lies somewhere
                        among
                        the
                        aptly named Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest in the White Mountains of eastern California â€” part
                        of
                        the
                        Inyo National Forest. Methuselah and other bristlecone pines are able to grow so old thanks to
                        biological adaptations that have earned them a place in the scientific category of
                        "extremophiles."

                    <h2>The oldest tree in Asia: <span> Cypress of Abarqu (Sarv-e Abarkuh)</span>: </h2>
                    <p class="lora ">The "Cypress of Abarqu" is an ancient cyprus tree (Cupressus sempervirens) that is located in the
                        Iranian city of Abarkuh and is estimated to be over 4,000 years old. This would likely make it
                        the oldest tree in Asia. Cyprus is a particularly notable tree species in Iranian history and
                        culture, and appears in Iranian poetry and carvings in Persepolis, the capital of the ancient
                        Achaemenid Empire.
                        The origins of the tree, also known as the "Zoroastrian Sarv", remain uncertain. An ancient
                        figure, the Cypress of Abarqu rises above many others to make it onto our list of the oldest
                        trees in the world.

                    <h2>The world's oldest clonal tree: <span> Pando</span>: </h2>
                    <p>Pando, also known as the "Trembling Giant", is a clonal colony of quaking aspen (Populus
                        tremuloides) that spans 106 acres of Southern Utah's Fishlake National Forest. What is clonal
                        colony? Unlike the other entries on this list, Pando is not one singular trunk with branches,
                        but instead many biologically identical trunks with a shared root system.At first glance,
                        Pando's approximately 47,000 aboveground stems appear to be individual trees.
                        Amazingly, each one is a genetically identical part of the same tree, connected by a vast
                        underlying root system that weighs about 13 million pounds. That makes it one of the largest and
                        heaviest land organisms on the planet.
